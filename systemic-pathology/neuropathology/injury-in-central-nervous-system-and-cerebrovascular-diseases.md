## Injury in central nervous system and cerebrovascular diseases

## Injury in central nervous system and cerebrovascular diseases

Name of the Lecture:

Injury in central nervous system and cerebrovascular diseases

Required Prior Knowledge:

* Basic vascular anatomy of CNS
* Basic gross anatomy of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum
* Basic histology of cell types in CNS
* Basic physiology of cerebrospinal fluid
* Basic physiology of blood brain barrier

Aim of the Lecture:

* To teach basic injury response of CNS to various lesions
* To teach pathology of fluid flows in CNS and pathologies related to vascular lesions

Goals of the lecture:

The students will learn:

* The basic reaction patterns to injury in CNS and how it differs from those of other organ systems
* Fluid imbalances in CNS
* Pathologies of flow of cerebrospinal fluid
* Cerebrovascular diseases
* The pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases, their macroscopic and microscopic features

The students will compare the morpgologic and pathophysiologic features with clinical presentations.

Lecture Outlines:

* Patterns of injury in the nervous system
* * Neuronal Injury, Red Neurons
  * Astrocytic reaction to the injury, Gliosis
* Edema
* * Vasogenic Edema
  * Cytotoxic Edema
* Herniation
* * Subfalcine \(cingulate\) herniation
  * Transtentorial \(uncinate\) herniation
  * Tonsillar herniation
* Hydrocephalus
* * Noncommunicating hydrocephalus
  * Communicating hydrocephalus
* Cerebrovascular Diseases
* * Stroke
  * Hypoxia
  * Global Ischemia
  * Focal Ischemia
  * Nonhemorrhagic Infarcts
  * Hemorrhagic Infarcts
  * Intracranial Hemorrhage
  * Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy
  * Saccular Aneurysms
  * Vascular Malformations
  * Hypertensive Cerebrovascular Diseases
  * Vasculitis
