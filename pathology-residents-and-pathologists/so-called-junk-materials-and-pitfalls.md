# So Called Junk Materials & Pitfalls

#### So Called Junk Materials & Pitfalls

The so-called junk materials are important

* major workload of a private practice
* problematic if normal histology and embryology is not well known \(normal structures may be mistaken as neoplasm\)
* important resource for immunohistochemistry controls
* incidental neoplasms are not uncommon
* systemic diseases like amyloidosis or vascultis may have features in these specimens
* proof of surgery in medico-legal cases and for billing purposes
* Normal histologic features are used to name or describe neoplasms
* Autopsy practice is in decline, these specimens are good to learn autopsy pathology
