#  Hallmarks of Cancer 

+ Self-sufficiency in growth signals

+ Evasion of cell death
+ Limitless replicative potential
+ Development of sustained angiogenesis
+ Ability to invade and metastasize
+ Genomic instability

#  Self-sufficiency in growth signals 

+ **ONCOGENES**
![](assets/img/image7.jpeg)

---
#  Self-Sufficiency in Growth Signals 

+ Physiologic Growth
	+ The binding of a growth factor to its specific receptor on the cell membrane
	+ Transient and limited activation of the growth factor receptor, which in turn activates several signal-transducing proteins on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane
	+ Transmission of the transduced signal across the cytosol to the nucleus by second messengers or a cascade of signal transduction molecules
	+ Induction and activation of nuclear regulatory factors that initiate and regulate DNA transcription
	+ Entry and progression of the cell into the cell cycle, resulting ultimately in cell division

#  Adenomatous Polyposis Coli  

+ APC is a tumor suppressor gene
+ With one mutant allele
	+ Hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon
	+ By age 20s
+ When other allele also mutated
	+ Malignant transformation
+ APC mutations are seen in 70% to 80% of sporadic colon cancers
+ Colonic cancers with normal APC genes have activating mutations of β-catenin
	+ Refractory to the degrading action of APC
